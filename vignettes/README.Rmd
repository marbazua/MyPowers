POWERS
========

This is an R package that provides functions to: square, cube, and compute the reciprocal of a vector. You can also apply a Box-Cox transformation to a vector and find the root(s) of a second degree polynomial. 

Installation
------------

You can install powers from github with:

```{r}
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("marbazua/powers")
```

A few examples of how to use the package:
-------
```{r}
powers::square(2)
powers::cube(1:10, add_plot=TRUE)
```

For more details please see the Vignette.

For Developers

The package has two internal functions:  `pow` that is used for the `square`, `cube`, and `reciprocal`. `c_root` that is used in `polynom`.
